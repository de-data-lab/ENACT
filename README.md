Everyone Names All Census Tracts (ENACT)

## Giving census tracts in Delaware human-friendly names

Currently, census tracts are named with numbers, and we have hard time remembering and communicating census tracts to each other.

Do you know where [Census Tract 30.02][1] is? What about [Census Tract 6.01][2]? You may find it difficult to recognize these regions. This repo's goal is to name census tracts with human-friendly names, such as "Riverside" and "Eastlake". 

## Challenge 

Naming census tracts requires human effort. The team at Data Lab had a hackathon where we manually lablled all census tracts in Delaware. The results are saved in the CSV file in this repo.

The next step is to make sure that these names actually represent names recognized by the people living in the geography. To do so, we need a web app that can do the following:

1. People can recommend to edit the names of census tracts
2. People can vote/like on the names of census tracts

The minimally-viable version of the app may be just a map with suggested census tracts. Anyone can submit edits on GitHub for this version.
